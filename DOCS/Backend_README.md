# CityFix - Municipal Complaint Management Backend

CityFix is a robust backend API for managing municipal service requests and complaints. It allows citizens to submit issues, departments to manage requests, and administrators to gain insights and control over the platform.

## 🔐 Demo Credentials

Use the following credentials to test the role-based access control (RBAC) across the API:

| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin@cityfix.local` | `securepassword123` |
| **Staff (Lead)** | `staff@cityfix.local` | `securepassword123` |
| **Citizen** | `citizen@cityfix.local` | `securepassword123` |

- **Postman Environment**: [See the postman collection's env here](./DOCS/CityFix-env.postman_environment.json)

*Note: You can use these credentials directly on the live URL via the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint to receive a JWT access token.*

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Node.js + Express**: Core web server
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for robust development
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL**: Database ORM and relational storage
- **Redis (ioredis)**: Caching layer and global rate-limiting store
- **Zod**: Strict request validation
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for priority and chargeable requests
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud image/document storage
- **Multer**: Memory-based multipart/form-data handling
- **Nodemailer**: Email integration for OTPs and notifications
- **Helmet + CORS**: API Security
- **Vercel**: Edge/Serverless deployment

## ✨ Features

- **Robust Authentication & RBAC**: Secure JWT-based authentication with distinct roles (`CITIZEN`, `STAFF`, `ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN`).
- **State Machine Workflow**: Complaints transition strictly through `SUBMITTED -> ASSIGNED -> IN_PROGRESS -> RESOLVED -> CLOSED` using atomic Prisma transactions.
- **Dynamic File Uploads**: Image evidence processing using Multer (`memoryStorage`), compressed by `sharp`, and streamed directly to Cloudinary.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrated Stripe checkout for premium priority processing and chargeable municipal services.
- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Cryptographically secure Stripe webhook listener.
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable system logging capturing critical state and role transitions for absolute transparency.
- **Analytics & Caching**: Intensive data aggregation endpoints (Admin Dashboards, Public Stats) highly optimized with Redis caching.

### 🌟 Unique Features
1. **Automated SLA Enforcement**: A background cron job periodically scans the database for `ASSIGNED` or `IN_PROGRESS` complaints that have breached their SLA deadlines, automatically flagging them and triggering notifications.
2. **Dynamic Priority Recalculation**: When a citizen pays for priority processing via Stripe, the webhook automatically shortens their SLA deadline based on environment multipliers and bumps them up the queue.
3. **Atomic Role Mutations**: When an Admin promotes a user to `STAFF`, the backend transactionally generates their interconnected `StaffProfile` (department linking). Demoting them safely orphans/archives it.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

1. **Vercel Serverless File System Restrictions**: Vercel executes serverless functions in read-only environments. We initially encountered `ENOENT: mkdir` errors when legacy upload middleware tried creating local temp folders. We overcame this by completely migrating our file processing to RAM (`multer.memoryStorage()`) and streaming raw buffers via Cloudinary's `upload_stream`.
2. **Stripe Webhook Raw Body Parsing**: Express's global `express.json()` parser consumes request streams, causing Stripe's cryptographic signature validation to fail. We solved this by conditionally applying `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` strictly to the webhook endpoint *before* the global JSON parser.
3. **Multi-Instance Rate Limiting**: Simple in-memory rate limiting leaks memory and fails horizontally on cloud deployments. We integrated `rate-limit-redis` tied to our `ioredis` instance, centralizing IP tracking across the entire distributed architecture.
4. **Environment Variable Integrity on Boot**: Serverless instances crashing silently due to missing environment configurations. We implemented a strict Zod parser (`src/config/env.ts`) that runs immediately upon script execution, safely falling back to defaults or intelligently formatting missing URI prefixes before binding.

## ⚙️ Local Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhmunna143/CityFix-backend.git
   cd CityFix-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in your PostgreSQL URL, Redis URL, Cloudinary, and Stripe credentials.

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   *The seed script safely populates departments, categories, and injects the demo credentials.*

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
